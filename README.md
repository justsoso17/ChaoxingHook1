This is a lightweight enhancement module for the Chaoxing (Xuexitong) application based on the Xposed/LSPosed framework. It is designed to provide a cleaner, more efficient learning environment by removing intrusive advertisements and optimizing the layout for productivity.


!Only for root user sadge. I've tried lspatch and sandbox both failed. If you have a better idea please leave a message.

Key Features
Bypass Splash Advertisements: Suppresses launch-screen ads by intercepting SplashViewModel and PromotionView logic, significantly reducing application startup time.

Remove Home Page Banners: Hides the scrolling advertisement banners in the home page header to focus on core functional areas.

Disable Recommended Feeds: Blocks the infinite "Recommended" post stream at the bottom of the home page, which often includes distracting social-media-style content.

Expand Recent Records: Overrides the hardcoded limit of "Recently Used" items, increasing the visible count from 3 up to 10 to facilitate faster access to frequent resources.

Remove ads in the message page

Support single device multi-account-signin. You can simply change a singlular char at the fingerprint key in the config file to make it different. Just keep the base64 formatt.

How to do the spoof location check in?
You don't need a UI to configure this. The module dynamically reads your desired coordinates from a local text file.

Open your Android file manager.

Navigate to the app's private external directory:
/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.chaoxing.mobile/files/

Once you have sent a checkin request, there should be a config file named as chaoxing_loc.txt .

Open the file and enter your target coordinates in the latitude,longitude format. (English comma only!!)
Config the specified switch.
Name and address keys can be shown on the teachers' side . You can use front end syntax to set their appearance but with certain limitation.



Save the file. The module will automatically read this file the next time you initiate a sign-in.

To Disable the Feature:
If you want to use your real location temporarily, simply change the text file content to -1,-1. The module will let the original request pass through untouched.

⚠️ Important Caveat: Map vs. Text Address
Please be aware of how the server handles this specific request:
If the sign-in initiator (e.g., your teacher) clicks into your specific sign-in details, the pinned location on the map will show your modified (fake) coordinates, but the text-based address displayed below it will still show your REAL address (derived from IP or underlying base stations).

So remember to change the address string when you spoof the location


Deep UI Cleanup: Automatically hides empty containers and specific title headers (such as the "Recommended" section) to ensure a seamless, native-looking interface.
